## Overview

Password Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords. It provides real-time feedback on password security, including checks for length, complexity, common patterns, and potential vulnerabilities. This tool aims to promote better password practices by educating users on creating stronger, more secure passwords.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Instantly assess password strength as you type.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Receive specific suggestions for improving weak passwords, such as adding uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters.
- **Security Metrics**: Displays scores based on factors like entropy, dictionary attacks, and brute-force resistance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design accessible via any web browser.
- **No Data Storage**: All analysis happens locally in your browser—no passwords are sent to servers or stored.
